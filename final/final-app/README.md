# Description of the project
This React single page app is for a virtual NPO called Survive Depression. Obviously, it is an organzition that tries to help people who suffer from depression and raise awareness and understanding of depression in society.

Since time is limited, only the link on the title, title image, Home, About, News, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Login could be used as navigation in this app. All the other links would be useless or navigate to external sites. 

And this single page application use the latest react-router-dom v6. All medical contents come from the American Psychaitric Association(https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression)

# Complex UI elements
1.accordion on FAQ page
2.drop-down menu

# Animation, transition and transform
Animation is used in the dropdown menu and the loading indictor
Transition is used in the footer's link, two buttons on the home page and login page 
Transform is used in the login page to make the form area center

# Loading indictor
Loading indictor could be shown by click the botton on the home page and login page. Since I don't use services, it doesn't relate to data loading and just a symbol shows there.
